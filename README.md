# Bitwarden Vault Backup Script

Automated Bitwarden vault backups with **multi-remote cloud storage support**. Backup to multiple cloud services simultaneously (S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Cloudflare R2, and 40+ others).

## üöÄ Quick Start (TL;DR)

### 1. Generate Rclone Config

```bash
# If you have this repo cloned:
./generate-rclone-base64.sh

# Interactive mode (create new config):
./generate-rclone-base64.sh --interactive

# Test config and save to file:
./generate-rclone-base64.sh --test --output my-config.txt

# Or manually create base64 from existing rclone config:
base64 -w 0 < ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

### 2. Minimal Configuration

Create a `.env` file with these **5 required variables**:

```bash
cat > .env << EOF
BW_CLIENTID=your_bitwarden_client_id
BW_CLIENTSECRET=your_bitwarden_client_secret
BW_PASSWORD=your_bitwarden_master_password
ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=your_strong_encryption_password
RCLONE_CONFIG_BASE64=your_base64_encoded_rclone_config
EOF
```

### 3. Run Backup

**‚ö° Fastest (No cloning required):**

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env --pull always --platform linux/amd64 \
  -e BITWARDENCLI_APPDATA_DIR=/tmp/bw_appdata \
  nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup:latest
```

**Or with Docker Compose:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup.git
cd bitwarden-backup
# Copy your .env file here
docker-compose up --build
```

**Or with scripts:**

```bash
./setup-rclone.sh && ./scripts/backup.sh
```

That's it! Your vault will be backed up to all configured remotes with encryption and compression.

## Example Multi-Remote Setup

Your rclone configuration can include multiple remotes:

```ini
[aws-s3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
region = us-east-1

[google-drive]
type = drive
client_id = 123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com
client_secret = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
token = {"access_token":"ya29.a0AfH6SMC..."}

[cloudflare-r2]
type = s3
provider = Cloudflare
access_key_id = your_r2_access_key
secret_access_key = your_r2_secret_key
endpoint = https://abc123.r2.cloudflarestorage.com

[dropbox-backup]
type = dropbox
token = {"access_token":"sl.B0abcdefghijklmnop..."}
```

The backup script will automatically:

1. Detect all 4 remotes
2. Upload your backup to ALL of them
3. Maintain separate retention policies for each
4. Track changes independently per remote

## üîÑ Backup Restoration

The `restore-backup.sh` script allows you to decrypt and restore your encrypted backups back to plain JSON format.

### Quick Restore Examples

```bash
# Decrypt a local backup file
./restore-backup.sh bw_backup_20241218123456.json.gz.enc

# Download and decrypt latest backup from S3 remote
./restore-backup.sh -r s3-remote

# List all available backups from all configured remotes
./restore-backup.sh -l

# Decrypt with custom output filename
./restore-backup.sh -f backup.enc -o my_vault.json
```

### Restore Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|:-------|:------------|:--------|
| `-f, --file` | Decrypt local backup file | `--file backup.enc` |
| `-r, --remote` | Download & decrypt from remote | `--remote s3-backup` |
| `-o, --output` | Custom output filename | `--output vault.json` |
| `-l, --list` | List backups from all remotes | `--list` |
| `--list-remote` | List backups from specific remote | `--list-remote gdrive` |
| `--download-only` | Download without decrypting | `--download-only` |

### Restoration Process

1. **üîç Validation** - Checks file existence and encryption password
2. **üîì Decryption** - Decrypts using AES-256-CBC with your password
3. **üì¶ Decompression** - Extracts gzip compressed data
4. **‚úÖ JSON Validation** - Ensures valid Bitwarden vault format
5. **üíæ Secure Save** - Saves with secure file permissions (600)
6. **üßπ Cleanup** - Removes temporary files

### Security Notes

* Restored JSON files contain **unencrypted vault data** - handle with care
* Files are created with secure permissions (owner read/write only)
* Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
* **Delete restored files** when no longer needed
* The same `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` from backups is required

```

**Enhanced Notification Details:**

The final notification now includes detailed per-remote status:

**Success Notification Example:**
```
Bitwarden backup script completed successfully. New backup uploaded: bw_backup_20241218123456.json.gz.enc.

Remote Status:
  ‚úì aws-s3: Success
  ‚úì google-drive: Up to date
  ‚úó dropbox-backup: Failed
  ‚úì cloudflare-r2: Success

Summary: 2 uploaded, 1 up-to-date, 1 failed
```

**No Changes Notification Example:**
```
Bitwarden backup script completed successfully. No changes detected, no new backup uploaded.

Remote Status:
  ‚úì aws-s3: Up to date
  ‚úì google-drive: Up to date
  ‚úì cloudflare-r2: Up to date
```

**Failure Notification Example:**
```
Bitwarden backup script failed with exit code 8.
Reason: Compression or encryption failed. Check ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD.

Remote Status at time of failure:
  ‚úì aws-s3: Success
  ‚úó google-drive: Failed
  ? dropbox-backup: Not processed
```

## Security Considerations

* **`.env` File**: Contains sensitive credentials. Set permissions to `chmod 600 .env`.
* **Backup Directory**: Set secure permissions `chmod 700` on backup directory.
* **Encryption Password**: Store securely and separately from backups. **Losing this password means losing access to your backups.**
* **Rclone Configuration**: Contains cloud storage credentials. The base64 encoding is for convenience, not security.
* **Multi-Remote Security**: Each remote should have appropriate access controls and encryption.

## Migration from R2-Only Version

If you're upgrading from the R2-only version:

1. **Keep your existing `.env`** - the new version is backward compatible
2. **Generate rclone config**: Use `./generate-rclone-base64.sh` to create `RCLONE_CONFIG_BASE64`
3. **Add the new variable** to your `.env` file
4. **Optional**: Remove old R2-specific variables (they're ignored now)
5. **Run the backup** - it will work with your existing R2 setup plus any new remotes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"RCLONE_CONFIG_BASE64 contains invalid base64 data" (Docker Hub image only):**

There's a known issue with the Docker Hub image having stricter base64 validation than local builds. If your base64 works with local Docker Compose but fails with the Docker Hub image:

**Workaround 1: Use local build instead**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup.git
cd bitwarden-backup
# Copy your .env file here
docker-compose up --build
```

**Workaround 2: Regenerate base64 (may help)**

```bash
base64 -w 0 < ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf | tr -d '\n'
```

This issue is being investigated - the local build is currently more reliable.

**No remotes found:**

* Ensure `RCLONE_CONFIG_BASE64` is properly set
* Test your config: `./generate-rclone-base64.sh --test`

**Upload failures:**

* Check remote credentials and permissions
* Verify network connectivity
* Review rclone configuration syntax

**Permission errors:**

* Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x *.sh scripts/*.sh`
* Check backup directory permissions

**Bitwarden unlock failures:**

The script includes automatic retry logic for vault unlock failures. If you're experiencing frequent unlock issues:

* **Increase retry attempts**: Set `BW_UNLOCK_RETRIES=5` (default: 3)
* **Increase retry delay**: Set `BW_UNLOCK_RETRY_DELAY=10` (default: 5 seconds)
* **Check network connectivity** to Bitwarden servers
* **Verify your master password** is correct in the `BW_PASSWORD` variable
* **Check for API rate limiting** if running frequent backups

**Platform warnings (Apple Silicon/M1/M2 Macs):**

If you see warnings like "The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8)":

```bash
# Add --platform flag to specify architecture
docker run --rm --env-file .env --platform linux/amd64 nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup:latest
```

This warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality, but the flag eliminates the warning.

**Read-only filesystem errors with Bitwarden CLI:**

If you see errors like `EROFS: read-only file system, open '/home/backupuser/.config/Bitwarden CLI/data.json'`:

This happens when the Docker container runs with a read-only filesystem but Bitwarden CLI needs to write configuration files. The Docker Compose file already handles this, but for manual Docker runs, add:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env -e BITWARDENCLI_APPDATA_DIR=/tmp/bw_appdata nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup:latest
```

**Using outdated Docker images:**

Docker may use cached local images instead of pulling the latest from Docker Hub. To ensure you're running the most recent version:

```bash
# Option 1: Use --pull always flag (recommended)
docker run --rm --env-file .env --pull always nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup:latest

# Option 2: Manually pull first, then run
docker pull nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup:latest
docker run --rm --env-file .env nikhilbadyal/bitwarden-backup:latest
```

**Note**: `docker-compose` automatically handles this with `pull_policy: always` in the compose file.

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Review script output for specific error messages
2. **Test rclone**: Use `rclone ls remote:` to test connectivity
3. **Validate config**: Use the `--test` flag with the helper script
4. **Check dependencies**: Ensure all required tools are installed
